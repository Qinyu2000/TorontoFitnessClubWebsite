# TorontoFitnessClubWebsite

This is a website built in my third-year course at University of Toronto.  The website is about Toronto Fitness Club. 
The detailed description is contained in Toronto_Fitness_Club_part_1.pdf and Toronto_Fitness_Club_part_2.pdf. 
The project contains two parts: backend and frontend. Backend code is in the PB folder while frontend code is in the pf folder. 
The backend uses Django as framework and simple JWT as authentication method. The fronted uses react as framework and MaterialUI for the UI. 
To run the project, run source startup.sh and then run source runserver.sh. The website is on localhost: 8000.
